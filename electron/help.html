                <p class="lead">TellyPrompt is the only app you need for running your teleprompter! From giving a speech to recording a live production, TellyPrompt can keep you on track with what you are saying.</p>
                <h2 id="quickstart">Quick Start</h2>
                <p>Getting started with TellyPrompt is easy! To get going quickly, all you need is a computer and something to say.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Write what you want to say in the Editor window</li>
                        <li>Click Start Presenting</li>
                        <li>In the Controller window, click the Start button</li>
                        <li>Read along, adjusting the speed with the slider at the top of the screen</li>

                <h1 id="hardware" class="page-header">Hardware Options</h1>
                <p class="lead">TellyPrompt was designed to be used with different hardware configurations, from just a laptop in front of you to a large studio with a dedicated teleprompter operator and 70/30 glass on the cameras. The options listed here are by no means complete, but rather are meant to be a starting point to get you going.</p>
                <h2 id="singlemonitor">Single Monitor</h2>
                <p>A single monitor is the easiest to get started with, but is also the most limited in usefulness. It could be used, for example, if you are giving a speech, with a laptop on the podium. You might also use it if you were recording an audio podcast or audio book.</p>
                <p>To use single monitor mode, make sure "Use Dual Monitor Setup" is unchecked in Settings, and click Start Presenting.</p>
                <h2 id="dualmirror">Dual Monitor (Mirrored)</h2>
                <p>Mirrored (or Duplicated) displays show the same content on both screens. With this configuration, both the person controlling and the person reading can see the same exact thing. This might be useful, for example, in an audio recording studio. The computer would be in the control room, with a second monitor in the audio studio for the person to read.</p>
                <p>To use Mirrored mode, ensure that your displays are configured to mirror (or duplicate) in the operating system, uncheck "Use Dual Monitor Setup" in Settings, and click Start Presenting.</p>
                <h2 id="dualextend">Dual Monitor (Extended)</h2>
                <p>Extended Desktop displays show different content on each screen. You basically have one large desktop that extends across both of your screens. This is helpful if you are using teleprompting glass on your cameras, because in order for the person on camera to read the text, it must be flipped (or mirrored) either vertically or horizontally.</p>
                <p>To use Extended mode, ensure that your displays are configured to extend in the operating system, check "Use Dual Monitor Setup" and select the screen that will be used for the display in Settings, and click Start Presenting.</p>
